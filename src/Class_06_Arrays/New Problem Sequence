2. 🔵 **Move all zeroes to end**  
   Shift all zeros to the end while maintaining the relative order of non-zero elements.  

3. 🔵 **Two Sum**  
   Find two numbers in the array whose sum equals a given target.  

4. 🔵 **Two Difference**  
   Check if there exists a pair with the given difference.  

5. 🔵 **Product Pair**  
   Find if there exists a pair with the given product.  

6. 🔵 **Pair sum closest to 0**
